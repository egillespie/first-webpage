<HR COLOR=GREEN>
<P>The first couple of days Joe and I were a little bit jet-lagged after being on an airplane for seven hours.  We didn't do much other than look at a few things in the Amsterdam and Amstelveen areas.  Amstelveen is a suburb of Amsterdam and it is where Keith lives.  I haven't used my digital camera much until this point so many of the early pictures I took didn't turn out well and I had to omit them.</P>
