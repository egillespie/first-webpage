<HR COLOR=GREEN>
<P>We visited Warwick castle today.  This is a huge castle and I think people still live in it from time to time.  Winston Churchill lived in it at one point I remember.</P>

<P>This was taken while going into Warwick.  There's no way I could have fit the whole castle in one picture.  You can see the main gate where we go in to the right.</P>
<IMG SRC="day7-2.jpg">
<P>Here is a closer shot of the main gate.  If you look towards the top, you can see part of a clock that was installed above the gate.</P>

<P>These are some pictures of the inside of the castle.  These pictures can give you a better idea as to how large this castle is.</P>

<P>In the middle of this picture is one of the towers of the castle.  On the left is the main gate where we came in, and on the right you can see the part of the living quarters of the castle.</P>

<P>Here are some better shots of the living quarters of the castle.  A lot of famous people have lived in this castle.  All of the modern conveniences have been added to the inside.</P>
<IMG SRC="day7-8.jpg">
<P>Here is the city the castle is located at.  Notice the large church.  We saw a lot of large churches while in England.  I thought they looked cool, but there were just so many of them.</P>
<IMG SRC="day7-9.jpg">
<P>Here is another picture of one of the castle's towers.  You can see the same large church as in the previous picture in the background.</P>

<P>One odd thing we discovered in England is that even if we weren't tired, we couldn't help nodding off every time we got in a car in England.  I think it might have something to do with driving on the opposite side of the road as we do in the United States.  I couldn't really get a picture of myself asleep, but here are pictures of Keith and Joe asleep in Joe's uncle's car.</P>
