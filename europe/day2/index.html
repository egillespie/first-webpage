<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Day 2</H1>
<HR COLOR=GREEN>
<P>Very little was done today, but at the end I was feeling very proud of myself after winning laser tag and figuring out in two days a puzzle Keith hadn't figured out since taking it apart when he first got it last Christmas.</P>

<P>This is the piece of paper showing I won laser tag.  There were two teams of ten or eleven people each.  Keith tells me that the kids we played were about half of his graduating class.  The place we played at was pretty big... there were three floors to play on.  Neither Keith nor Joe were on my team, their names were Red Puta and Joe, respectively.</P>
