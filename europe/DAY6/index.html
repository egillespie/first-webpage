<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Day 6</H1>
<HR COLOR=GREEN>
<P>Joe's uncle drove us out to Wales to visit a couple of castles today.  The first castle we visited is in Caernarfon and the second castle is in Conway.</P>

<H3>Caernarfon</H3>
<IMG SRC="day6-1.jpg">
<P>This is the front entrance of Caernarfon.  These castles are much larger than the previous castle we visited in Holland.  So large that I had to take three pictures to get the whole wall.  I combined the three pictures into one; the seams aren't as noticeable as the bowed vertical edges and mismatched coloring on the castle.</P>
<IMG SRC="day6-2.jpg">
<P>This is a view of one of the walls of Caernarfon from the inside.  This picture was made from combining two seperate pictures.</P>
<IMG SRC="day6-3.jpg">
<P>Here is a view of the wall I was standing on to take the last picture.  This one only took one picture.</P>
<IMG SRC="day6-4.jpg">
<P>Yet another shot of the castle from the inside.</P>
<IMG SRC="day6-5.jpg">
<P>This picture has a view of the country on the outside of the castle.  Most pictures I took while in England (including this one) have rain clouds in them.  No matter where you are in England, you're always only a few hours away from the the ocean.  Because of this, England has a lot of clouds.  That doesn't necessarily mean it rained a lot while we were there though.</P>
<IMG SRC="day6-6.jpg">
<P>This is a look into the town from the top of one of the castle walls.</P>
<IMG SRC="day6-7.jpg">
<IMG SRC="day6-8.jpg">
<P>These are two pictures of the inside of one of the castle towers.</P>

<P>Joe and Keith pointing their cannons at me.</P>

<IMG SRC="day6-12.jpg">
<P>While leaving Caernarfon, we saw several paragliders flying above us.  We probably saw in excess of ten paragliders so I'm guessing it's a fairly popular recreational sport in England.</P>
<H3>Conway</H3>
<IMG SRC="day6-13.jpg">
<P>This is one of the few shots of Conway I actually took.  You can see that the design was quite different from that of Caernarfon though.</P>
<IMG SRC="day6-14.jpg">
<P>This picture was taken from the inside of one of the towers.  You can see the British flag and a beautiful sky if nothing else.</P>
<IMG SRC="day6-15.jpg">
<P>You can see that Conway was built on the shore of a shallow waterway.  Both Conway and Caernarfon were built along the shore of the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
<IMG SRC="day6-16.jpg">
<P>This is a picture of the other side of the waterway.  (The same side Conway is on.)</P>
<IMG SRC="day6-17.jpg">
<P>This is one of the early suspension bridges.  I believe the only traffic allowed on this bridge is by foot.</P>
<IMG SRC="day6-18.jpg">
<P>A shot of one of the towers of Conway.  You can see Keith and Joe in this picture too.</P>
